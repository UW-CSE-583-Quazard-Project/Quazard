### Case from Ted
If a data analyst in a marketing team who uses Qualtrics forms to collect very large data from  various users, he / she would not be able prepare the data manually because the form is too complex
The form contains several groups of users who have very different experience, which means they need many different headers and subheaders to contain the data.
Now he / she might want to organize the the data by inputting corresponding parameters, and potentially he / she also wants to eliminate missing data points. Then he / she can use our tool to automatically finish this job in no pain.
